# THE SICILIAN PUPPETS

## About

This is a design histroy research project which aims to summarize the development of sicilian puppets.
In short, the sicilian puppets and its theatre arts, which begin from 1500s in the period of Renaissance
at Italy and continues to our modern life,  are now the intangible cultural heritage. It was the preeminet
form of cultural expression for working-class southern Italians and Sicilians, yet its subject matter was 
nothing less than the masterpieces of medieval and Renaissance chivalric literature.  

In this project I studied the form, the materials, the structure, the craft and the function of the sicilian puppets.
Then the theatre arts of sicilian puppets together with the ordinary culture and society background of the puppet show are 
also studied. A comparision with the Japanese Ningyo Johruri Bunraku Puppet Theatre has been made and the project ends with discussions of 
the puppet show's nowadays situation and possible future.
